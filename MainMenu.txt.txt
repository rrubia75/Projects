“Your eyes open.”
“As your vision begins to focus, you are laying in a dark, musky room.”
“You sit up and realize you are in what appears to be a basement."
"The only light in the room is the moonlight peering through a tiny window with metal bars."
“You see a body lying on the floor across the room from you"
"Suddenly you hear the body let out a low, raspy moan.”
“You get up, shake out the feeling of fatigue, and begin to look around.”
“To your left, you see a set of stairs leading up to a door."
"You make your way slowly up the stairs and try the doorknob.”
“<The door is locked>”
“You start to turn around to head back down the stairs."
"Suddenly, you hear an extremely loud, very high pitch shriek “Hahehehehe”.”
“You sprint down the stairs and you notice that the body that was lying on the floor is now sitting up."
"It is an older man with grey, shaggy hair that is sitting with his knees to his chest."
"The old man is slowly rocking back and forth, staring blankly ahead.”
“He slowly mumbles; “That’s the Witch. I’ve been here for weeks. She’ll never let us go.”
“You begin to frantically search the room. You don’t find anything."
"You notice the old man slowly raise his hand and point to the corner of the room.”
“There sits a small table with a very old book and a key sitting in front of it.”
“You walk to the book and try to read, but notice the language is one that you do not recognize.”
“However, you notice there are notes scribbled to the side in English:"
“To banish a Witch, you need the following ingredients;"
"1.) Fur of a bat, 2.) Something made of silver, 3.) Leaf of a poison ivy plant.”
"Combine these ingredients into a bowl and set on fire, and the Witch shall be banished.”
“As you finish reading these words, you hear the old man say;"
“If you pick up that key, you’ll be able to unlock the door."
"The man continues;"Just beware of the Witch. If she finds you, she’ll bring you straight back to the basement.""
“With these words in mind, your journey begins.”
